Visualizations are very lucid, interpretable and beauriful. This project covers the impact of the 2017 Mumbai Rains and Delhi, and Smog visually. 

## How did I build this?

- Scraped tweets using tweepy
- Heavy data processing (primarily used Pandas + geo-data packages in python)
- Created visualizations and built the web app using [plotly](https://plot.ly/)
